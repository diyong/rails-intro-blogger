# Intro to Rails: Blog Project

This project allowed me to become familiar with and practice Rails project generation and Ruby gem implementation.

I have learned how to get a Rails project up and running as well as implement Form-Based Workflow. I have come to a better understanding of the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, data structures and relationships, routing, migrations, views (w/ forms, partials, and helpers), Representational state transfer (REST) design, as well as adding Ruby gems for additional features.

For future Rails projects, I wish to further practice my understanding of the MVC pattern and data structure/relationships. 

For this project specifically, I wish to come back to further enhance this basic project to include additional security measures and to enhance user interface/design.
